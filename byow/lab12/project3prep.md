# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: Havent seen it yet, staff said they will release a video.

N/A

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: I think the hexagon would be individual rooms and hallways,
and the tesselation would be the combination of these rooms and hallways into a 
world that obeys certain properties, like how there cant be
unreachable rooms.

Rooms and hallways would need to be right next to each other, similar to how hexagons hear were tessellated.
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: Probably a method that generates random rooms/hallways. Although Im sure this method
would lead to smaller helper methods, perhaps for generating walls or something.


Creating a basic hexagon.
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

<<<<<<< HEAD
Answer: Different purposes, though they come together to form something greater (i.e. a house).
=======
Answer: A hallway is just a room that must have a width of 1-2
tiles. Both must have random length (width for rooms too) and there must be some rectangular rooms.
